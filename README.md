# M8 Guide & Reference

A collection of printable, high-density reference guides for the **Dirtywave M8 Tracker** (Firmware 6.5+). Big shoutout to https://github.com/LaurentVitalis/M8Guide for the original guide that a lot of the
these guides is based off (especially the well designed template for having the svg buttons generated by javascript)

## 🛠️ Customization & Technical Details

### Shortcuts System

Shortcuts are stored as a JS array in `data.js` and rendered via `script.js`. This makes it easy to update descriptions or reorder sections without touching complex HTML.

### Button Icon Syntax

Button icons use a single SVG template customized via CSS classes. For example, to illustrate `hold SHIFT + OPTION then double-tap EDIT`, use:
`"command": "shifthold option1st edit2nd double"`
